# PyOBD Professional Dashboard

A modern, open-source OBD-II diagnostic tool and dashboard built with Python. Designed to work with **ELM327 USB adapters**, this tool allows you to monitor vehicle sensors in real-time, read/clear check engine lights, and log data for analysis.

## Features

*   **Live Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of RPM, Speed, Coolant Temp, Voltage, and more with analog gauges.
*   **Performance Mode:** 
    *   **Virtual Dyno:** Estimate Horsepower and Torque curves based on vehicle physics.
    *   **Drag Strip:** Automatic 0-100 km/h (0-60 mph) performance timer.
*   **PyCAN Hacker:** A separate, dedicated tool included for reverse engineering CAN bus traffic and finding new PIDs.
*   **Live Graphing:** Distinct multi-axis graphing to correlate data (e.g., RPM vs. Fuel Pressure).
*   **Automated Analysis:** Built-in logic engine to detect anomalies (e.g., high load at idle, overheating, stuck thermostat) based on sensor combinations.
*   **Customizable Layout & Themes:** Switch between Cyber (Neon), Amber (BMW), Matrix, and Solar themes.
*   **Data Logging:** Automatically save sensor data to CSV files for Excel/Sheets analysis.
*   **Diagnostics:** Read and Clear Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs / Check Engine Light).
*   **Safety Backups:** "Full Backup" feature saves a snapshot of the car's state (Freeze Frame data + Codes) to a JSON file before you wipe them.
*   **Demo Mode:** Built-in simulation to test features without being connected to a car.

## Professional Data Packs

The open-source version supports standard OBD-II protocols (Emissions, RPM, Speed, Temps). However, manufacturers often hide specific data (Hybrid Battery Health, DPF Soot Levels, Transmission Temp) behind proprietary codes.

**Pro Packs are available for purchase on our Gumroad store.**

These JSON packs unlock manufacturer-specific sensors for brands like Toyota, VW, Ford, and BMW.

*Do you have a specific car? If you help me verify the PIDs, I will give you the Pro Pack for free.*

### How to install a Pro Pack:
1.  Purchase/Download the `.json` (or `.obd`) file for your car model.
2.  Place the file inside the `pro_packs/` folder in the application directory.
3.  Open the App → **Settings** → **Manage Pro Packs**.
4.  Enable the pack and click "Save & Reload".

## Hardware Requirements

*   **Computer:** Windows, Linux, or macOS.
*   **Adapter:** ELM327 USB Adapter.
    *   *Recommended:* Version with **PIC18F25K80** chip and **FTDI** or **CH340** USB drivers.
    *   *Note:* Avoid generic "blue" KKL/VAG-COM cables; they are not ELM327 compatible.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Paul-HenryP/PyOBD-Dashboard.git
    cd PyOBD-Dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Connect your Adapter:**
    *   Plug the ELM327 USB into your computer.
    *   Plug the other end into your car's OBD-II port.
    *   Turn the ignition to **ON** (Engine can be off or running).

## Usage

**Running the Dashboard:**
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Running the CAN Hacker Tool:
```bash
python src/sniffer_main.py
```

## Using the Interface:
Select your USB Port from the dropdown (or use "Auto").
Select "Demo Mode" to test the interface without a cable.
Click Connect.

## Disclaimer
This software is provided "as is". Clearing fault codes does not fix the underlying mechanical problem. Always backup your codes using the "Full Backup" feature before clearing them so you have a record for your mechanic.
The CAN Hacker tool allows raw data injection. Use with extreme caution and never inject random data while the vehicle is in motion.
